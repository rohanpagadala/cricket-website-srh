# Sunrisers Hyderabad

This is a one-page web application that highlights the dream T20 squad of Sunrisers Hyderabad, also known as the Orange Army. The website displays a visually engaging layout with team branding, including the official logo, slogan, and player showcase.

The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and allows users to search for players, filter by role, and view detailed T20 statistics. Clicking on any player card opens a modal that shows extended stats like matches played, strike rate, jersey number, and best performance.

This project was developed as part of the "Squad Goals" frontend challenge, aimed at building an interactive and stat-packed cricket fan page.

Team Slogan: "Rise Up to Every Challenge"
Featured Players: David Warner, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Pat Cummins, Kane Williamson, Yuvraj Singh
